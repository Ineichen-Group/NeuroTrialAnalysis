177885,NCT00382824,Not Applicable,"The clinical syndrome of PSP responds poorly to all available forms of therapy used in Parkinson's Disease (PD). Currently, no effective treatment exists. Coenzyme Q10 in high doses has been shown to be a beneficial therapy in PD and might possibly be a beneficial therapy for PSP. This study will compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of Coenzyme Q10 versus placebo in patients with atypical parkinsonian syndrome, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)."
1855238,NCT02642289,Not Applicable,This study evaluates the benefits of probiotics in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome.
777924,NCT01542892,Not Applicable,"Several trials have found that nutritional supplementation can elicit an increased rate of skeletal muscle protein synthesis following a single bout of exercise in both young and older individuals. However, there have been no studies that have investigated if nutritional supplementation and exercise can cause a sustained increase in physical functioning and fat free mass, particularly in older adults with functional limitations. This study will compare the effects of a nutritional supplement versus a placebo on exercise training induced changes in physical functioning older adults who are at risk for mobility disability."
2362950,NCT04327726,Not Applicable,"Postdural puncture headache (PDPH) is a common complication, following neuraxial techniques. The obstetric population is particularly prone to PDPH. Therefore, treatment of PDPH is a key issue in obstetric anesthesia.

Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective, centrally acting α2-adrenergic agonist with analgesic and anxiolytic effects. Moreover, it decreases cerebral blood flow (CBF) in humans and animals secondary to cerebrovascular vasoconstriction. It has been used via the intranasal and inhalational routes for many purposes including premedication, sedation and postoperative analgesia. Because of its desirable properties, we hypothesized that dexmedetomidine nebulization could be effective in the treatment of patients suffering from PDPH after caesarean section."
2527754,NCT05382026,Not Applicable,"Canada's Food Guide places an increased emphasis on plant-based proteins; however, Canadians who consume a plant-based diet may be compromised because of intake of lower-quality protein. Consumption of high-quality protein is important during growth and development, especially in highly active individuals. The study will compare milk (i.e. high quality protein) to a pea-based beverage (i.e. lower quality plant-based protein) in adolescent boys and girls who are engaged in resistance-training programs as part of their athletic training. One-hundred and fourteen adolescent boys and girls (12-17y of age) will be divided into groups that consume milk, a pea-beverage, or a carbohydrate (sugar) beverage after resistance training sessions performed three times per week for six months. It is predicted that the group consuming milk will have greater increases in muscle mass, strength, and bone density, and greater reductions in fat mass compared to the groups consuming a pea-based or carbohydrate beverages."
1986142,NCT02991001,Not Applicable,"Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common peripheral entrapment neuropathy with involving compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel. Rather than other progressive disease, CTS is characterized by remission and recurrence. The hydrodissection could decrease the entrapment of nerve to restore blood supply. Despite the hydrodissection was pervasively used in clinical practice, current researches contain small participant without control group or randomized leading to foreseeable selection bias. The investigators design a randomized, double-blind, controlled trail to assess the effect after ultrasound-guided hydrodissection in patients with CTS."
1281853,NCT02323048,Not Applicable,"The aim of the study is to extend our investigations of drug-associated conditioning with healthy volunteers. The investigators have recently completed a pilot study demonstrating that subjects show an increase in self-reported preference for a visual stimulus paired with stimulant drug administration. Furthermore, our pilot data suggest that methamphetamine acts synergistically with rewards in the environment, such that this conditioning effect is facilitated by experiencing the drug in the presence of rewarding, or positive events, such as earning money. The investigators now aim to extend these findings by assessing not only self-reported preference, but also attentional and psychophysiological (electromyogram; EMG) responses to the drug-associated stimuli."
780011,NCT01547494,Not Applicable,"The purpose of the study is to assess whether, in individuals with migraines, a low-fat, vegan diet improves pain more effectively than a control supplement or a placebo. The principal measures are pain as measured by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and the change in migraines frequency. The study duration is 36 weeks."
844525,NCT01641120,Not Applicable,The purpose of this study is to evaluate patients' views when injecting Avonex intramuscularly.
2526153,NCT05374681,Not Applicable,"Chronic subdural hematomas (CSH) are collections of blood in the subdural space. CSH are becoming the most common cranial neurosurgical condition among adults, and a significant public health problem, due to an increasing use of anticoagulant and antiplatelet medication in an ageing population. Symptomatic CSH, or CSH with a significant mass effect, are treated surgically. However, recurrences are common (10 to 20%). Conservative management (medical) is used in patients who are asymptomatic or have minor symptoms. However, therapeutic failures, requiring surgical treatment, are common. The pathophysiology of CSH involves inflammation, angiogenesis, and clotting dysfunction. Self-perpetuation and rebleeding is thought to be caused by neo-membranes from the inflammatory remodeling of the dura-mater mainly fed by the distal branches of the middle meningeal artery (MMA). There are 13 ongoing registered RCTs in CSH, with the most common covering application of steroids, surgical techniques and tranexamic acid. Further to this, there are trials running on other pharmacological agents, and peri-operative management. Some industrial or academic trials are or will enroll in France in the next year in France. But to our best knowledge, none of these trials will the eventual benefits of the MMA embolization in both cases of medical and/or surgical management, and none will focus on the use of cyanoacrylates (CYA) for this purpose.

Preliminary case series and nonrandomized retrospective studies have suggested that MMA embolization alone or as adjuvant therapy to surgery can decrease recurrences.

The investigators hypothesize that in both conditions of conservative or surgical managements, endovascular embolization of patients with CSH significantly reduces the risk of recurrence of CSH. The investigators choose the CYA as liquid embolic agent because of the pain and cost of the use of Ethylen Vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVOH) agents and its simplicity to be used."
523139,NCT01126099,Not Applicable,A study of outpatient participants with Alzheimer's disease or a related dementia who have difficult behaviors that are upsetting for them or their caregivers. Prazosin is a medication that is commonly used to treat people with high blood pressure. Research with prazosin has shown that it may be effective in treating behavioral problems by reducing excess adrenalin effects in the brain.
437281,NCT00875342,Not Applicable,"This study proposes to evaluate the effects of D-cycloserine (DCS) combined with cognitive-behavioral treatment with exposure therapy in a sample of patients who developed posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a consequence of various traumas (e.g., motor vehicle and accidents, burns and other injuries, combat, World Trade Center attack, etc.). In addition, this study hopes to determine whether a common human genetic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in a growth factor, brain derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF SNP (Val66Met), predicts treatment response to PTSD.

Patients living in areas that are not geographically proximal to the Weill-Cornell Medical Center New York City campus will receive cognitive behavioral therapy using telemedicine (videoconferencing technology).

Overall, this study aims 1) to determine if subjects administered DCS show a significantly larger decrease in symptoms of PTSD as compared to those administered a placebo, 2) to determine if subjects administered DCS show a decrease in PTSD symptomatology significantly earlier (as measured by weeks) than those administered a placebo, 3) to determine if differences in symptomatology are evident at a 6-month follow-up and indicate long-term differences between groups, 4) to determine if the BDNF SNP predicts treatment response, 5)to determine if it is feasible and acceptable to provide imaginal exposure (IE) therapy for PTSD using videoconferencing technology."
1989755,NCT03032302,Not Applicable,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) refers to neuronal damage occurring as the result of an external force being applied to brain tissue. In the United Kingdom annual figures (2013-2014) show 449,000 hospital admittances with a diagnosis of head injury with males up to five times more likely to sustain a head injury than females. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes life-long disability, with no significant reduction in life expectancy, affecting a diverse range of cognitive and social functions including memory, task planning and execution, impulse control, social interactions, personality changes and depression. Following traumatic brain injury acquired deficits can lead to problems with resumption of aspects of daily life, particularly in terms of returning to work and interpersonal relationships.

The initial injury triggers a secondary cascade of metabolic, neurochemical and cellular changes within the brain, primarily aimed at limiting damage and stimulating repair. Paradoxically prolonged secondary cascade mechanisms, including haemorrhage, oedema, neuroinflammation and axonal injury, results in exacerbation of deficits observed. The heterogeneous on-going nature of the secondary cascade presents clinicians with opportunities to intervene in an attempt to limit neuronal damage. A large body of nutritional research has been focused on addressing the hypermetabolic and catabolic states created by secondary cascade processes in the acute stage. Addressing these demands has played a significant role in reducing mortality and infection rates following head injury, however there has not been the same depth of research investigating the post-acute period (once individuals are discharged from hospital)."
2037767,NCT03247998,Not Applicable,"After a stroke caused by a blockage (clot) in a blood vessel in the brain, patients may have the clot removed by threading a catheter from the groin up to the affected area of the brain. An anesthesiologist is involved in the patient's care during this procedure to maximize patient safety and procedural efficiency. The options for anesthesia for this procedure are general anesthesia (where the patient is unconscious) or sedation (where the patient is in a relaxed, calm, sleepy condition). Currently, it is unclear which of these anesthetic options contributes to the best patient outcome. The investigators would like to investigate whether or not one method of anesthesia (general or sedation) is better to use than the other when removing the clot."
2058553,NCT03354624,Not Applicable,The purpose of this study is to investigate the sensory-motor cortical excitability response to delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) on Extensor Carpi Radialis (ECR) muscle during muscle hyperalgesia provoked by nerve growth factor (NGF).
2443800,NCT04852484,Not Applicable,"The aim of this study will be to compare the effects of morphine versus ketamine when they are used as adjuvants to the local anesthetic in paravertebral nerve blocks performed with the aid of ultrasound. Furthermore, a group of local anesthetic without an adjuvant, will also be compared to the two groups"
304558,NCT00628017,Not Applicable,"This preliminary study is aimed to investigate whether it is feasible to conduct a study to use fish oil compared to the placebo(olive oil) in people with cognitive impairment. We will also explore whether fish oil has better efficacy in some clinical aspects in people with cognitive impairment during 24 weeks intervention. The major clinical outcome will be:

845391,NCT01651520,Not Applicable,In this study the investigators will use PET and 11C-Flumazenil to visualize and quantify neuronal injury in the cortex and the deep gray matter of Multiple Sclerosis patients at an early stage. The investigators will follow up patients to determine the prognostic value of this neuronal injury.
2351385,NCT04217187,Not Applicable,The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of using electrical stimulation to improve upper extremity function in stroke survivors who receive botulinum toxin injections for spasticity. We hypothesize that individuals who receive the electrical stimulation could demonstrate improved benefit of the botulinum toxin injections and improved functional use of their weaker upper extremity.
1284409,NCT02347605,Not Applicable,"The purpose of this study is to determine if changing the timeframe (relative to cue presentation) at which the nicotine lozenge is given can attenuate the increase in symptoms of tobacco craving and withdrawal that occur when smokers are presented with smoking cues. In this cross-over study, all subjects attend three laboratory sessions at which either nicotine lozenge or placebo is given prior to presentation of smoking cues or after presentation of smoking cues. The order in which the three conditions will be presented are randomized."
